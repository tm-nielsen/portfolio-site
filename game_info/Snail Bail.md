# About
A challenging platformer with puzzle elements and a unique premise. Your character leaves behind a solid trail of slime, at the end of which is an enemy that will kill you. You must keep moving to avoid the enemy, and use the slime trail to reach the objective, overcoming a number of puzzles and platforming challenges. I am very happy with the concept and game feel. Made for the 2021 Innovator's Game Jam hosted by the University of Alberta Engineering Innovation Hub

# What I Learned
My main challenge with this project was coordinating with a younger team member. Communication required extra care as I tried to assist and guide without being patronizing.
