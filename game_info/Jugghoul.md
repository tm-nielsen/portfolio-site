# About
A bite sized rage game about juggling, made for Global Game Jam 2024. A culmination of my legacy of evil games spanning all the way back to YUT YUT.

# The Initial Jam
This was the first in person game jam I'd done since GGJ 2020, which was my first ever. It was a good experience to meet and collaborate with total strangers in real life. I ended up in a team of significantly varied experience levels, coordinating the initial roles accordingly to do the rest of it myself while avoiding the mentor role that I often step into, especially with students. I ended up calling upon a couple of friends remotely for sound effects a music. On the technical side, it was just practice and expression.

# Arcade Port
Following Clack and Big Boy Beach Ball, this was the next most exciting candidate for the CGDA arcade machines. I really like the game, and the generally confrontational design philosophy is a great fit for an arcade cabinet. A number of others had even asked about whether I was going to get this project specifically onto the arcades. However, I couldn't figure out how to get it working. The base input mechanism is entirely dependent on the mouse for simultaneous fine control over both the aim and strength of throws. It would also be really cool to focus on another project, maybe one I could use that silly little trackball for.

Inspiration!

And so, the game got a little tricker, a lot sillier, and a whole lot harder to explain. On the arcade machines, players will juggle pins by spinning the trackball to manually throw each time. It's hilarious, and adds a deliciously kinetic aspect to the frantic gameplay.

I've focused mainly on project planning/management as well as implementing polish, but our overall priority is the tutorial.

Still a work in progress, but we are hopeful to have it on the cabinets for the November deadline.
