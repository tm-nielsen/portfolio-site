## About
A short study of juice, made in a few days. I had a larger idea about a multiplayer version where players would fight with and over a single arrow with significant emphasis on movement for getting and dodging the arrow. Thankfully I cut the idea way down to this simple study.

## What I Learned
This is in a line of projects where I just had a fun little idea and some time. With a solid grasp of how to scope effectively, I could really just make things. This project was practice in animation, player movement, and particle effects using tools I was already familiar with.
