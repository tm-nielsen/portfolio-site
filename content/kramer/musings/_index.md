This game and the system it runs on are on ongoing experiment. Over each session, I've tried out new elements or stress-tested existing ones, iterating on my tools and growing as a GM. Every 1-3 hour session is followed by a 2-4 hour period of collaborative analysis and feedback. This page is a place to dump some of the thoughts players and I have had along the way.

> The thing forms itself; I am the medium.

## Current Focus
Things have gone *Seinfeld* -> *Frasier* -> *Community*, edged towards *Regular Show*, but are correcting to somewhere between *Scooby Doo*, *Twin Peaks*, and *Murdoch Mysteries*. Paranormal elements providing a narrative backbone to support character exploration, development, and interaction. Horror as a straight man.

## Initial Concept
> ***Seinfeld RPG***

As it was spoken, I knew it had to be done.

First crutch I reached for was the open table. While minimizing scheduling headaches, the format also lets me play with a wide mix of people *(better test data)* and fits in quite well to the sitcom format with a rotating cast of occasionally returning characters. Second, this was a great excuse to mess with [*Sentiment*](https://www.patreon.com/sentimentttrpg): a system very close to my heart. I was very eager after recently having run a short 2+1 session test with the system proper *(in 0.7 beta)*. The attributes underlying the whole system crystallize and empower meaningful character with accessible simplicity. Accessible enough, I hoped, to work at an open table with inexperienced players.

To accomplish the grander vision, I had a few primary goals for system, setting, and execution:
- Maximize newcomer accessibility
- Supercharge characterization
- Encourage interpersonal conflict
