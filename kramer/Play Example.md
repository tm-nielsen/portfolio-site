# Example of Play
> Moving Day!  
> You found this place dirt cheap online and signed a lease without looking to hard.

## Darius
Yeah I'm just hoping for something stable after relying on friends for so long.

> Wonderful.  
> What did you bring with you to move in?

Darius has a small backpack and a duffel bag.

> Fantastic.  
> You got an email from the property manager telling you to pick the keys up from underneath the doormat.

So I'm just gonna go up and grab those, then head down.  
It was a basement, yeah?

> Yep.  
> You can make your way around back and head down.  
> Its a simple place with a kitchenette, bathroom.  
> Otherwise just one big room.  
> What did Darius bring to sleep on?

Oh he'll just be raw dogging on the floor.  
First thing though, he gets set up in the corner.

Pulling out a small mirror and dirty jar from his duffel bag, Darius just gets set up in a corner putting on his clown makeup.

> Give me a [Roll to Do][Do]

*[Rolls to Do][Do]*  
Well I'm gonna have to use my red for this, and that's a 3.

> Okay, so that's decent.  
> Not great.

> Elina, Moving Day!  
> Excited for your first day of classes tomorrow, you've arrived at the place you've leased for the semester.  
> How are you feeling?

## Elina
### *[Rolls to Discern][Discern]
My green was highest. I'm looking forward to this new chapter of my life, ready to take on the challenges presented to me.

> It was clear during the walkthrough that this place is pretty bare, what all did you bring to move in?  
> Do you have anyone with you to help with furniture?

Nope, she packed light.  
Just the backpack.

> Great.  
> You use your key and head down, what is Elina getting up to first?

I guess she'll get her stuff down and start getting settled.

> As you round the corner at the bottom of the stairs, you see a man hunched over in the corner, barely illuminated by the flickering light of the bathroom opposite.  
> His face is smeared half-white, though you can barely make it out in the dim light.  
> Darius, what does you do as you hear small footsteps approaching?

## Darius
He quickly turns away and screams "Don't look at me when I'm naked"

> [Roll to Do][Do]  
> Elina [Roll to Die][Die]

That's a red 5

## Elina
I got a green 4
> Describe to me how you take 5 damage from seeing this horrible gremlin in your new home.

She's rattled.  
This was supposed to be the start of something new and everything is already going wrong.  
But she's not going to let that stop her.  
She turns to this guy and asks him "how old are you"

> [Roll to Do][Do]
Red 6

## Darius
Red 2

> Same colour means that's a [Clash][Clash].  
> 12 damage.  
> Darius, [Wound][Wound] your red, describing to me how this completely devastates it.

Well red is his passion for clowning.  
"You kids these days dno't have any appreciation for the arts!"  
"It's all tick tock and Coco melon you can't appreciate a real performance"  
He starts crying like an ipad baby.

> [Roll to Do][Do]

Yellow 5

## Elina
Red 6

> Tell me how you completely reflect this sad display.

Oh she's already completely disregarded this man as a facet of the room.  
Almost a force of nature, he's just going to be there and she's already living with it.
