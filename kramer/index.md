A high lethality sitcom role-playing game orbiting *Kramer County Community College*, players navigate silly situations and awkward social dynamics while prodded by a facilitator. Character and narrative are centred over mechanics in this laughs-first open table campaign.

## Resources
- [Character Creation](character-creation) *(~3 min + time to stew)*
- [System Rules](system) *(~6 min)*
    - [Quick Reference](system/reference) *(~1 min)*
    - [Example of Play](system/example) *(~4 min)*

## Scheduling
Kramer County is run as an ***Open Table***.  
This means there is no fixed schedule, group of players, or commitment beyond a single session. When you want to play, reach out to other players and find a time that works for all of you, then check with the facilitator. The facilitator may also propose session times filled on a first come first serve basis.

## Additional Reading
This game and the system is runs on have been massively *(though unintentionally)* influenced by the Old School Renaissance philosophy of rpg design. [This primer][0] may help introduce players to the underlying approach to play.
