*Please create your character **before** attending a session.*  
*All gameplay materials will be provided.*
# Kramer County
is a high lethality sitcom role-playing game orbiting *Kramer County Community College*. A story-first campaign, play focuses on character and narrative over mechanics. Players navigate silly situations and awkward social dynamics while prodded by the facilitator.

## Scheduling
Kramer County is run as an ***Open Table***.  
This means there is no fixed schedule, group of players, or commitment beyond a single session. When you want to play, reach out to other players and find a time that works for all of you, then check with the facilitator. The facilitator may also propose session times filled on a first come first serve basis.

## Character Creation
*Kramer County* uses a custom system to provide mechanical backing to character dynamics.

### Attributes
> \[A character] consists of three unique stats, each with a name and a colour. These ***Attributes*** are your character's core personality traits, convictions, features, and interests.

To create your character, you must invent and name these three ***Attributes***.

#### Names
> You may name ***Attributes*** in any way, from 'Crystal Girlie' to 'Beatboxing' to 'My old Co-Worker Brendan'. Poetry, Unicode characters, drawings, or anything else you can think of to meaningfully represent an aspect of your character are also valid.

> These names are critically important, as all three represent your character entirely!
> Whatever you choose, have a clear idea of what these ***Attributes*** represent, and how to communicate that with your facilitator as needed.

#### Colours <img src="colour words.png" align="right" style="max-height: 12rem;" />
> ***Attribute*** colours are entirely vibe-based, though a rough guide is provided in the *Colour Words* graphic. Each ***Attribute*** must be a different colour. Attempting to balance or concentrate a character around the wheel may help guide their formation, but take care to avoid using one of the guiding colour words as an ***Attribute***. While allowed, you won't have much fun playing a boring character!

### Guiding Questions
*I don't need your answers to these questions, and neither do you.  
They are meant to get the process started.*
- What does your character smell like?
- How old is their phone?
- What kind of bread do they eat?
- What impression do they leave on other people?
- Why is your character in community college?
	- What are they studying?
	- What is their job?
	- What do they do on campus if not study or work?
- How old are they?
	- *roll 1d100 + 10*
- Do they own an air fryer?
	- Do they use it?
	- Would they like to?

### Examples
*Do you disagree with any of these?  
Good.  
Use the spite as creative fuel.*

### Notes
While the name and colour of an ***Attribute*** are typically permanent, your first session with a character is a chance to feel out who they are through play. You may adjust names and colours as appropriate before they are locked in for any future sessions.

***Attributes*** are not shared with other players by default. They are as secret as you'd like them to be. Sharing them is fun, but more impactful if saved for a fitting character moment.
