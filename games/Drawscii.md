## About
A little toy paint program made to draw ascii art. Made with Love2D for the University of Calgary Game Design Club's text-based game jam.

## What I Learned
While this is made with Love2D, it isn't written in lua. Instead, I used a language a friend was working on at the time called Jammy, which transpiled to lua. It was interesting to use a higher level scripting language for a game, which was significantly different from the C# I was primarily used to at this point. It was VERY interesting to use a transpiler that was actively in development and had no useful error outputs other than bothering the person who made it. Overall very cool and fun to make.
