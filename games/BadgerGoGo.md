## About
A short text based adventure in which you are a badger. Made for the University of Calgary Game Design Club's 2021 text based game jam.

## What I Learned
After using the C# with Unity for many projects, this was an excuse to use the language "raw". It was fun to play around with some language features outside of the engine in a very low-stakes, small scale project.
