## About
A little rougelike built in two weeks for the 2020 Lowres jam. I made this with a friend with comparable experience, splitting tasks based on interest and need.

## What I Learned
The entire game had to be within a 64x64 screen. That constraint is what makes the lowres jam so cool and interesting. Designing a character, enemies, animations, and an environment that could be readable and interesting at that size was a very interesting challenge. This also served in the line of iteration (in it's implementation) from Counter Castle through to Drum Pit.
