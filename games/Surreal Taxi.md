## About
An arcade driving game with obvious inspirations, in this game you have to ferry hat goblins around in a strange geometric plain. If you get airborne, you can perform tricks for extra money that means nothing. Customers speak gibberish supplied by a markov chain of copypastas. Most excitingly, the game has a killer dynamic soundtrack that will respond to being stopped or airborne. Made for lame jam 9.

## What I Learned
This project had a sizeable and experienced team and so required special effort to cut the intended scope of the project into pieces fit for each member. My primary contribution was the car, both the 3D and handling model which is based on manipulating a sphere collider that acts as the physics base of your vehicle. The movement of the car's model is just a display on top of the sphere, responding to changes in velocity and orientation. I also got to work with our composer to implement the dynamic audio using in engine audio filters for different scenarios. I have brought both aspects into many future games, most prominently in what Golfo is becoming.
