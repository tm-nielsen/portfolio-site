## About
A comfy aquarium game, made for the 2020 Out of Hibernation Game Jam hosted by the University of Alberta Games Den

## What I Learned
This is from the second game jam I ever participated in, I only did about half the pixel art (everything that isn't a fish). Other, more experienced members of the team coordinated more explicitly, giving me the opportunity to contribute to a team in a defined role. I had to learn how to work outside of my comfort zone, making sprites to what was needed while trying to share what I knew when it could be helpful.
