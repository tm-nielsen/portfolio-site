## About
A weirdly niche little vector editor. Split off from the larger Big Boy Beach Ball remake to serve as a character creator for Big Boy Balance Beam, which is another splinter from the same project.

I'd been sitting on the functionality for over a year, but ported everything over to Godot 4 and got it all working on a web in parallel with the development of Big Boy Balance Beam for the CGDA arcade cabinets.
