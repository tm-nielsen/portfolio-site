## About
A weird take on a matching game where you have to attach limbs to bodies then match limbed bodies together for points using a fired projectile to select.

## What I Learned
My primary contribution to the project was figuring out how to make the limbs wiggle and attach to bodies and each other using joint components in Unity.
