## About
A relaxing digital instrument built to recreate and expand upon a toy application I made when I first started making games. A grid of dots is disturbed dynamically by mouse clicks. In this version, a simple "radial instrument" has been added that can play 4 different not samples at different pitches, switching between major and minor by clicking in the middle. This is something I keep on my desktop to fiddle around with when I need it. Made for the 2022 Games Den Quicker game jam.

## What I Learned
I had wanted to remake the program in something more performant after losing the original to a hardware failure before I knew about source control. I had also been meaning to try out monogame for some time. These desires collided in the convenience of a game jam. Using C# with a lower level framework was an absolute joy.
