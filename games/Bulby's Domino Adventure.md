## About
A simple 3D platformer. Run around as a cute little character and knock over dominoes. There was plans of a more complex puzzle game with coloured lights, but most all complexity got cut. Made for the 2021 Alberta Game Jam

## What I Learned
Having done several jams at this point, is was used to working with programmers, artists, musicians, but this project introduced me to working with a team of people that had been formally trained in game design. Of the five of us, three were fresh grads with a game design certificate (or diploma) from the University of Lethbridge. They had knowledge of design and engine work, but I found it challenging to navigate their completely different approach to development, in addition to engine troubles. I did not do nearly as good of a job at it than I could have. It was an excellent learning experience working with people from different technical backgrounds under pressure of a time restraint.
