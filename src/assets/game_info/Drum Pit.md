# Description
Drum Pit is a game about hitting things with a stick, the culmination of several experiments in animation and systems design. It is a 2D combat platformer with rougelike dungeon generation and progression, discoverable upgrades, multiple weapon types with complex attack trees, a complex final boss, fully remapable controls, absurd graphical settings including the ability to remap the palette to custom colours and a posterization slider, and a wide range of custom foley. I am very proud of most every aspect of this project, but the level, enemies, and boss do not compliment the depth of the player's combat abilities very well. They're just there to have something to do, which is why I added them.

# What I Learned
I made this project to cap off the combat system I started with Counter Castle and to effectively express my prowess in pixel art animation. In these and many other areas, this project was a strengthening of skills and ideas I'd been honing for years. However, two areas stand out. Firstly was self management on the scale of a project I spent more than a year developing alone. It is no small task. Second is foley. I was lucky enough to connect with a local composer who graciously provided the score of the game. Sound effects, I did myself. With the exception of the rainstick, which I ended up sampling, every sound effect in the game is something I personally recorded. This was enormously fun and I am elated to never do it again because of the wonderful audio-talented collaborators I've met over the years.
