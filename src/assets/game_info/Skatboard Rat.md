# Description
A dinosaur game clone with a rat on a skateboard.

# What I Learned
I made this after hearing that Blender could be used for 2D animation, and to see if I could use that for a game. I have since found alternatives, but it was fun to play around with the grease pencil and practice some animation that wasn't pixel art.
