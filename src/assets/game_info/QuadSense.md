# Description
A weird puzzle game where you have to use unconventional methods to navigate a maze. Made for Global Game Jam 2021.

# What I Learned
The main things I learned from this project where the results of it's experimentation with the user experience. It's not very fun to have your primary means of navigation taken away if the thing replacing it isn't interesting and reliable. This was also the first project I use shaders in a meaningful capacity. I also learned how bad of an idea it is to try and teach newcomers on a highly unconventional project.
