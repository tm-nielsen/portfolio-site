# Description
A top down (twin stick shooter??) where you have to turn all the citizens of a small town into monkeys and bring them back to the jungle. Made for the 2021 Out of Hibernation Game Jam hosted by the University of Alberta Games Den.

# What I Learned
I mainly just did art, where I got to play with a perspective I wasn't familiar with. I also did a bit of engine/programming work implementing the animations I made.
