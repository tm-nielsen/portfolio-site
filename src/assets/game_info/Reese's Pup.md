# Description
A top down dog themed dungeon crawler with a dodge roll where you have to fight chocolate. Made for the 2023 Inn From the Cold Game Jam hosted by the University of Calgary Game Design Club.

# What I Learned
The combat system in this game is technically an offshoot of the one in Drum Pit. This project was practice working significantly with another programmer on the same project in a very short period of time.
