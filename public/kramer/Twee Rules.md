is a character-rich story-focused de-make of the [***Sentiment***](https://www.patreon.com/sentimentttrpg) ttrpg system.

## Attributes
Every character consists of three unique stats, each with a name and colour.  
These ***Attributes*** are your character's core personality traits, convictions, features, and interests.

### Names
You may name ***Attributes*** in any way, from 'Crystal Girlie' to 'Beatboxing' to 'My old Co-Worker Brendan'. Poetry, Unicode characters, drawings, or anything else you can think of to meaningfully represent an aspect of your character are also valid.

These names are critically important, as all three represent your character entirely!  
Whatever you choose, have a clear idea of what these ***Attributes*** represent, and how to communicate that with your facilitator as needed.  
*The name of an attribute is permanent and cannot be changed without undergoing significant narrative and mechanical character growth.*

### Colours <img src="colour words.png" align="right" style="max-height: 12rem;" />
***Attribute*** colours are entirely vibe-based, though a rough guide is provided in the *Colour Words* graphic. Each ***Attribute*** must be a different colour. Attempting to balance or concentrate a character around the wheel may help guide their formation, but take care to avoid using one of the guiding colour words as an ***Attribute***. While allowed, you won't have much fun playing a boring character!

### Levels
Each ***Attribute*** has an associated level, which adds a bonus value to a roll when you lock it in as your ***Swing***. As a character progresses through multiple sessions, you may spend ***Experience*** points to increase these bonuses individually. ***Attribute*** levels can be tracked on your character sheet next to the relevant dice slots. The bonus is equal to the level, starting at 0.
 
## Dice
Each ***Attribute*** is represented by a coloured d6 which are used to act on or react to the world around you. Normally living in their home slots on your character sheet, performing a roll using an ***Attribute*** dice will bring it to the forefront. This die is placed in the ***Swing*** slot.  
*You are encouraged to roleplay your character as embodying their active attribute.*

Rolls are largely self-determined by player intention, but the facilitator will regularly call strays as they are caught in freeform dialogue.

### Roll to ***Do***
Whenever you perform an action or influence something in the world, you ***Roll to Do***.  
This could be anything from lifting a box to hitting someone or hitting on them.
- Roll all ***Attribute*** dice
- Select one to act with
	- *add attribute level*
- Lock it in as your new ***Swing***

While you will normally want to use the highest value, you will have to justify to the facilitator how and why your character is using that ***Attribute*** to perform the action *(if not self-evident)*.
*Bonuses may be granted by the facilitator based on clever incorporation of context like a prop.*
#### Success
When rolling against another character, you will be contesting a roll to die.  
The ***Roll to Do* must exceed the *Roll to Die*** in order to succeed, dealing damage equal to your Swing (die value + attribute level).  
In other situations, you may simply roll against a static threshold determined by the facilitator.
#### Clashes
If you ***Roll to Do*** using a die the same colour as your target's current ***Swing***, it becomes a clash. This matching die must then be rolled in response.
- A successful attack deals double damage.
- A successful defence grants a free action as a counter.
- A tie banks the damage and prompts a reroll. This banked damage will be dealt to the losing party along with the value of the winning roll.
	- *Damage banked by successive tied clashes can stack indefinitely.*

### Roll to ***Die***
When acted against, you ***Roll to Die***.  
This is your roll to weather external action, influence, or attack.
- Select an ***Attribute***
- Roll single die
	- *add attribute level*
- Lock it in as your new ***Swing***

### Roll to ***Discern***
At any point outside of a fixed turn order, roll your ***Attributes*** to examine your character's inner thoughts or feelings. The values presented by the dice can help guide character or roleplay decisions. A higher value in one stat might mean a certain tendency or viewpoint is acting up while a lower value could indicate a lack of confidence.
- Roll all ***Attribute*** dice
- Assess the vibe
- Lock one in as a ***Swing***

### Health, Damage, and Wounds
A successful ***Roll to Do*** deals damage equal to your ***Swing*** *(die value + attribute level)*.  
Each character starts with 10 health points.  
When all health is lost, your character is ***Wounded***
- Select the most relevant attribute to ***Wound***
	- discard ***Attribute*** die
	- *completely unusable until healed*
- Restore health to full
- **Mark a point of *Experience***

*You are encouraged to roleplay what your character would be like in the complete absence of one of their core characteristics.*

Whenever a character is ***Wounded***, they may choose to exit the scene. *(giving up, running away, fainting, crashing out)*.
#### Death's Door
Upon wounding your last ***Attribute***, you may choose to continue on ***Death's Door*** with 5 health points and a final colourless die with which to act. Upon loosing all health in this state, your character will be narratively obliterated and removed from play.

A character on ***Death's Door*** may not leave a scene in conflict.  
*Continuing on death's door grants 1 point of experience.*  
*Surviving a hit on death's door grants 2 points of experience.*

## Progression
During play, ***Experience*** points are awarded for character moments like achievements or personal growth. The most consistent way to gain ***Experience*** is by taking ***Wounds***. These can be spent at the end of session on the following:

| Action | Cost                                 | Description                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Heal   | 1                                    | Restore all ***Wounded Attributes***     |
| Bulk   | 2, 4, 6...                           | Increase max health by 5                 |
| Level  | 1, 3, 5... *(1 + 2 x current level)* | Increase an ***Attribute***'s level by 1 |

*Attributes may also be healed, levelled, and altered in combination at a discount representative of character growth if it can be narratively justified to the facilitator.*
### Gifts
As part of character progression, the facilitator may offer you the option to spend ***Experience*** on a special ability called a ***Gift***. The availability of this option is based on the presence of a compelling idea and it's relevance to your character. You may bring suggestions to your facilitator. ***Experience*** may also be spent on certain ***Gifts*** to increase their potency.
#### Examples
##### I Know A Guy
Once per Session - Name and conjure an individual fit to tackle the issue at hand.

Roll a number of d6s determined by the facilitator based on their potential helpfulness.  
The lowest die value decides your relationship with this individual.
##### Confrontational
Action - In addition to a match, you may also clash with colours adjacent to your swing on the colour wheel.

Deals +2 damage rather than double. Ties function normally.  
*Could be levelled up to deal normal clash damage.*
