# Description
A bite sized rage game about juggling, made for Global Game Jam 2024. A culmination of my legacy of evil games spanning all the way back to YUT YUT.

# What I Learned
This was the first in person game jam I'd done since GGJ 2020, which was my first ever. It was a good experience to meet and collaborate with total strangers in real life. I ended up in a team of significantly varied experience levels, coordinating the initial roles accordingly to do the rest of it myself while avoiding the mentor role that I often step into, especially with students. I ended up calling upon a couple of friends remotely for sound effects a music. On the technical side, it was just practice and expression.
