# About
A tiny nothing game about a silly little guy stacking boxes. Made for lame jam 12.

# What I Learned
I made this project to learn in-engine inverse kinematics, which I did. It's a very useful thing that I haven't yet found much of a use for, at least directly. The skeleton morphs and head jiggle of ET-Skate can be traced back to this.
