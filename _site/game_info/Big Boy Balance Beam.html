<p>A simple little PvP physics game built for the CGDA arcade cabinets where you jump around as a squishy little orb character to knock your opponent into the water. This is both a remake of a minigame from Big Boy Balance Beam and a splinter off the remake of the base project that has become Boy Maker.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 arcade game jam, its organizers expressed interest in including other local projects that satisfied certain minor functional requirements and a general standard of polish. Becoming slightly obsessed with the design constraint of the arcade context, I could identify many small projects in my portfolio that could be expanded or redesigned to fit with relative ease. After cleaning up my initial entry to the game jam: Clack, this was my second arcade project.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>The core shape drawing and squishing functionality could all be ported more or less directly from what is now Boy Maker, but was slightly improved in a number of areas. I expanded/adjusted the custom physics system, adding the titular balance beam and choosing to ignore the shape of a ball, using simple circular collisions that are all factored in before applying resultant forces. I generalized the character shape loading and drawing to swap out and scale dynamically.</p>

<p>I created several playable characters and a juicy screen to select them from. Characters scroll through a carousel, squishing along the way. The player can select one by pressing a button when they appear or using the joystick for precise selection. Available characters can be selected from the default set, or an arbitrary of others included as SVG files in a folder alongside the game. This is intended to include any number of custom characters created with Boy Maker or any other vector editor <em>(with limited support)</em>.</p>

<p>There was also the whole game to make around that, largely consisting of juice. I made some cool shader water and metaball splashes. When hitting the water hard, a single big drop will shoot back up out of the water, which was a happy accident of applying metaball logic to warp the waterâ€™s surface.</p>

<p>Backgrounds are rendered separately in 3D. Unsure of what to put back there, I tried out some simple textures to see if anything stuck. I really loved the grungy mixed media look and leaned into it immediately.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>This project was quality experience with porting/reusing legacy code, and sticking to very limited scope. There are many things I intend to improve about the implementation I reused. However, I took a very low commitment game jam attitude going into this project. It was created explicitly as a short tangent: something small and silly to build quickly, put out, and never touch again.</p>
