<p>Drum Pit is a game about hitting things with a stick, the culmination of several experiments in animation and systems design. It is a 2D combat platformer with rougelike dungeon generation and progression, discoverable upgrades, multiple weapon types with complex attack trees, a complex final boss, fully remapable controls, absurd graphical settings including the ability to remap the palette to custom colours and a posterization slider, and a wide range of custom foley.</p>

<p>I am very proud of most every aspect of this project. However: the level, enemies, and boss do not compliment the depth of the player’s combat abilities very well. They’re just there to have something to do, which is why I added them.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>I made this project to cap off the combat system I started with Counter Castle and to effectively express my prowess in pixel art animation. In these and many other areas, this project was a strengthening of skills and ideas I’d been honing for years. However, two areas stand out.</p>

<p>Firstly was self management on the scale of a project I spent more than a year developing alone. It is no small task.</p>

<p>Second is foley. I was lucky enough to connect with a local composer who graciously provided the score of the game. Sound effects, I did myself. To my memory, every sound effect in the game is something I personally recorded. This was enormously fun and I am elated to never do it again because of the wonderful audio-talented collaborators I’ve met over the years.</p>
