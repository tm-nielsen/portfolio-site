<p>A simple real time strategy game that ticks to the beat. Made for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam. I really like the concept and feel of the game, but it lacks the clarity and/or complexity that (in my understanding) makes RTS games really work. Iâ€™d love to remake this someday with a proper tutorial, more complex unit types, better management UX, fleshed out objectives, and maybe even some kind of small scale campaign.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>I mostly did art, but also had to coordinate with two other programmers in a very short period of time.</p>
