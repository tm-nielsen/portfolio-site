<p>A physics based puzzle game make for Global Game Jam 2025 with the theme “Bubble”, players control a little puffer-fish that can blow bubbles to push blocks around. A distance from the rest of my work.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>After having a really solid streak of projects very much in my regular vein for the last three jams I did, I was aiming to focus on playing support this time around. I ended up doing just that: working with a team with software development experience, but little in Godot. Focused mainly on art, filling in what was needed for more involved programming of underlying systems. We had a working prototype within the first couple hours using the engine’s built in physics. Then, the big problem of making a puzzle game presented itself: we would actually have to make puzzles. I thought this might be a chance to push myself with some concrete design work I rarely do, but I didn’t end up needing to. Instead, I spent my time making some neat water type shaders and animating the character. Enough time was granted with the base character controller and interaction systems to infuse them with an amount of juice I could be satisfied with. I was quite happy to be able to touch that off with the amount of polish and fun that I’ve come to expect from myself. Though we only had time for a few basic puzzles, we ended up with a cute little project in the end.</p>
