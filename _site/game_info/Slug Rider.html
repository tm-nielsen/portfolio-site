<p>A very simple skateboarding games using 2D sprites in a 3D environment. Spiritual successor to Skatboard Rat and ancestor to ET-Skate.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>I had wanted both to experiment with the 2D-in-3D look and to make a 3D skateboarding game for a while. I used a game to do both. Ripped most of the handling model from surreal taxi (forces on orb) and added the ability to spin around in the air, and to stop and look around. The sprites were made using Pencil2D, which was awesome to use, and gave me a very fun bit of practice in drawn animation.</p>

            document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]')
            .forEach(checkbox => checkbox.removeAttribute('disabled'))
        </script>
