<p>A comfy aquarium game, made for the 2020 Out of Hibernation Game Jam hosted by the University of Alberta Games Den</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>This is from the second game jam I ever participated in, I only did about half the pixel art (everything that isnâ€™t a fish). Other, more experienced members of the team coordinated more explicitly, giving me the opportunity to contribute to a team in a defined role. I had to learn how to work outside of my comfort zone, making sprites to what was needed while trying to share what I knew when it could be helpful.</p>

            document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]')
            .forEach(checkbox => checkbox.removeAttribute('disabled'))
