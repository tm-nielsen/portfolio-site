<p>A little rougelike built in two weeks for the 2020 Lowres jam. I made this with a friend with comparable experience, splitting tasks based on interest and need.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>The entire game had to be within a 64x64 screen. That constraint is what makes the lowres jam so cool and interesting. Designing a character, enemies, animations, and an environment that could be readable and interesting at that size was a very interesting challenge. This also served in the line of iteration (in itâ€™s implementation) from Counter Castle through to Drum Pit.</p>

            document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]')
            .forEach(checkbox => checkbox.removeAttribute('disabled'))
