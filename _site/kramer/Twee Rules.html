<h1 id="twee">Twee</h1>
<p>is a character-rich story-focused de-make of the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sentimentttrpg"><strong><em>Sentiment</em></strong></a> ttrpg system.</p>

<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>Every character consists of three unique stats, each with a name and colour.<br />
These <strong><em>Attributes</em></strong> are your character’s core personality traits, convictions, features, and interests.</p>

<h3 id="names">Names</h3>
<p>You may name <strong><em>Attributes</em></strong> in any way, from ‘Crystal Girlie’ to ‘Beatboxing’ to ‘My old Co-Worker Brendan’. Poetry, Unicode characters, drawings, or anything else you can think of to meaningfully represent an aspect of your character are also valid.</p>

<p>These names are critically important, as all three represent your character entirely!<br />
Whatever you choose, have a clear idea of what these <strong><em>Attributes</em></strong> represent, and how to communicate that with your facilitator as needed.<br />
<em>The name of an attribute is permanent and cannot be changed without undergoing significant narrative and mechanical character growth.</em></p>

<h3 id="colours-">Colours <img src="colour words.png" align="right" style="max-height: 12rem;" /></h3>
<p><strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> colours are entirely vibe-based, though a rough guide is provided in the <em>Colour Words</em> graphic. Each <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> must be a different colour. Attempting to balance or concentrate a character around the wheel may help guide their formation, but take care to avoid using one of the guiding colour words as an <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong>. While allowed, you won’t have much fun playing a boring character!</p>

<h3 id="levels">Levels</h3>
<p>Each <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> has an associated level, which adds a bonus value to a roll when you lock it in as your <strong><em>Swing</em></strong>. As a character progresses through multiple sessions, you may spend <strong><em>Experience</em></strong> points to increase these bonuses individually. <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> levels can be tracked on your character sheet next to the relevant dice slots. The bonus is equal to the level, starting at 0.</p>

<h2 id="dice">Dice</h2>
<p>Each <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> is represented by a coloured d6 which are used to act on or react to the world around you. Normally living in their home slots on your character sheet, performing a roll using an <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> dice will bring it to the forefront. This die is placed in the <strong><em>Swing</em></strong> slot.<br />
<em>You are encouraged to roleplay your character as embodying their active attribute.</em></p>

<p>Rolls are largely self-determined by player intention, but the facilitator will regularly call strays as they are caught in freeform dialogue.</p>

<h3 id="roll-to-do">Roll to <strong><em>Do</em></strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you perform an action or influence something in the world, you <strong><em>Roll to Do</em></strong>.<br />
This could be anything from lifting a box to hitting someone or hitting on them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Roll all <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> dice</li>
  <li>Select one to act with
    <ul>
      <li><em>add attribute level</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lock it in as your new <strong><em>Swing</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While you will normally want to use the highest value, you will have to justify to the facilitator how and why your character is using that <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> to perform the action <em>(if not self-evident)</em>.
<em>Bonuses may be granted by the facilitator based on clever incorporation of context like a prop.</em></p>
<h4 id="success">Success</h4>
<p>When rolling against another character, you will be contesting a roll to die.<br />
The <strong><em>Roll to Do</em> must exceed the <em>Roll to Die</em></strong> in order to succeed, dealing damage equal to your Swing (die value + attribute level).<br />
In other situations, you may simply roll against a static threshold determined by the facilitator.</p>
<h4 id="clashes">Clashes</h4>
<p>If you <strong><em>Roll to Do</em></strong> using a die the same colour as your target’s current <strong><em>Swing</em></strong>, it becomes a clash. This matching die must then be rolled in response.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A successful attack deals double damage.</li>
  <li>A successful defence grants a free action as a counter.</li>
  <li>A tie banks the damage and prompts a reroll. This banked damage will be dealt to the losing party along with the value of the winning roll.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Damage banked by successive tied clashes can stack indefinitely.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roll-to-die">Roll to <strong><em>Die</em></strong></h3>
<p>When acted against, you <strong><em>Roll to Die</em></strong>.<br />
This is your roll to weather external action, influence, or attack.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select an <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong></li>
  <li>Roll single die
    <ul>
      <li><em>add attribute level</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lock it in as your new <strong><em>Swing</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roll-to-discern">Roll to <strong><em>Discern</em></strong></h3>
<p>At any point outside of a fixed turn order, roll your <strong><em>Attributes</em></strong> to examine your character’s inner thoughts or feelings. The values presented by the dice can help guide character or roleplay decisions. A higher value in one stat might mean a certain tendency or viewpoint is acting up while a lower value could indicate a lack of confidence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Roll all <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> dice</li>
  <li>Assess the vibe</li>
  <li>Lock one in as a <strong><em>Swing</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="health-damage-and-wounds">Health, Damage, and Wounds</h3>
<p>A successful <strong><em>Roll to Do</em></strong> deals damage equal to your <strong><em>Swing</em></strong> <em>(die value + attribute level)</em>.<br />
Each character starts with 10 health points.<br />
When all health is lost, your character is <strong><em>Wounded</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Select the most relevant attribute to <strong><em>Wound</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>discard <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> die</li>
      <li><em>completely unusable until healed</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Restore health to full</li>
  <li><strong>Mark a point of <em>Experience</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>You are encouraged to roleplay what your character would be like in the complete absence of one of their core characteristics.</em></p>

<p>Whenever a character is <strong><em>Wounded</em></strong>, they may choose to exit the scene. <em>(giving up, running away, fainting, crashing out)</em>.</p>
<h4 id="deaths-door">Death’s Door</h4>
<p>Upon wounding your last <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong>, you may choose to continue on <strong><em>Death’s Door</em></strong> with 5 health points and a final colourless die with which to act. Upon loosing all health in this state, your character will be narratively obliterated and removed from play.</p>

<p>A character on <strong><em>Death’s Door</em></strong> may not leave a scene in conflict.<br />
<em>Continuing on death’s door grants 1 point of experience.</em><br />
<em>Surviving a hit on death’s door grants 2 points of experience.</em></p>

<h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
<p>During play, <strong><em>Experience</em></strong> points are awarded for character moments like achievements or personal growth. The most consistent way to gain <strong><em>Experience</em></strong> is by taking <strong><em>Wounds</em></strong>. These can be spent at the end of session on the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Heal</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Restore all <strong><em>Wounded Attributes</em></strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bulk</td>
      <td>2, 4, 6…</td>
      <td>Increase max health by 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Level</td>
      <td>1, 3, 5… <em>(1 + 2 x current level)</em></td>
      <td>Increase an <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong>’s level by 1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Attributes may also be healed, levelled, and altered in combination at a discount representative of character growth if it can be narratively justified to the facilitator.</em></p>
<h3 id="gifts">Gifts</h3>
<p>As part of character progression, the facilitator may offer you the option to spend <strong><em>Experience</em></strong> on a special ability called a <strong><em>Gift</em></strong>. The availability of this option is based on the presence of a compelling idea and it’s relevance to your character. You may bring suggestions to your facilitator. <strong><em>Experience</em></strong> may also be spent on certain <strong><em>Gifts</em></strong> to increase their potency.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<h5 id="i-know-a-guy">I Know A Guy</h5>
<p>Once per Session - Name and conjure an individual fit to tackle the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Roll a number of d6s determined by the facilitator based on their potential helpfulness.<br />
The lowest die value decides your relationship with this individual.</p>
<h5 id="confrontational">Confrontational</h5>
<p>Action - In addition to a match, you may also clash with colours adjacent to your swing on the colour wheel.</p>

<p>Deals +2 damage rather than double. Ties function normally.<br />
<em>Could be levelled up to deal normal clash damage.</em></p>
